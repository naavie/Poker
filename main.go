// -----
//			Black: 2H 3D 5S 9C KD  White: 2C 3H 4S 8C AH

// Function: Turing a string into a card: How do I turn the string into a card?

//- The first character of a card string is its number and the second character is the card’s suit.

// - To convert a string into a card, we can create a new card and select the 0th and 1st elements.
// - The 0th element can be used to set the card’s number and the 1st element can be used to set the card’s suit.
